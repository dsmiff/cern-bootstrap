# site
### Main
The main page is [`home.php`](https://github.com/dsmiff/site/blob/master/home.php). It is a PHP extension to the CERN user-specific site. The layout is pretty self-explanatory.
For automated plots look in the
```shell
susy
```
directory where you will find a collection of PHP and CSS files.
### SUSY
Regarding SUSY work, plots are repeatedly made and to host them on a site is labourious. The PHP file [`ins.imgs.php`](https://github.com/dsmiff/site/blob/master/susy/ins-imgs.php) shows all images satisying the suffix requirements. There will be a PHP file per control region.
The PHP file requires PHP to work your server.
